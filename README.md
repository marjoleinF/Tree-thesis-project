# Meetings

## Meeting 1: March 7, 13:00-14:00

Study the Hill et al. (2010) paper (see BART folder). You can skip sections 3.3 (survival models), 4.2 (soft BART) and 6 (whole chapter on causal inference). Make sure you study the other sections well. For parts you do not understand well, you phrase specific questions.
