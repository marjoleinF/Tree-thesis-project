# Tree thesis project

In this repository, we will be sharing materials for the internship & thesis project on trees.

# Meetings


## Meeting 1: March 7, 13:00-14:00

Study the Hill et al. (2020) paper (see BART folder). You can skip sections 3.3 (survival models), 4.2 (soft BART) and 6 (whole chapter on causal inference). Make sure you study the other sections well. For parts you do not understand well, you phrase specific questions.


## Meeting 2: March 21, 15:00-16:30

* Replicate the plots on the effect of alpha and beta in "BART-priors.pdf" (see folder BART)

* Write a half- to one-page summary on BART.

* Fit a BART model on a benchmark dataset. Hint: Use R package dbarts, function bart or bart2 (for a regular prediction model), function bart_vi for a multilevel prediction model. 

* Work on your thesis proposal.
